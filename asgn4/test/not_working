Test cases not working:

test5 - alias
		syntactically correct but parser3 is showing a syntax error

test6 - arrays
		both syntactically and semantically correct, running in ruby compiler but not working with parser3

test17 - bitwise OR |
          both syntactically and semantically correct, running in ruby compiler but not working with parser3.

test18 - logical OR ||
          both syntactically and semantically correct, running in ruby compiler but not working with parser3.


All demo cases working fine
