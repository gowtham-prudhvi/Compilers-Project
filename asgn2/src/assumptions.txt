ASSUMPTIONS MADE ALONG THE WAY:

ELIMINATED-call has no return

line numbers and actual line numbers in ir are same

SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE:no a=a+b types for now

register contains single variable
variable is in single location
i.e, 1 variable 1 register

ELIMINATED-if integer in an operation then it is second input(a=b+1 not a=1+b)
