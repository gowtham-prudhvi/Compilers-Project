# Compilers Final Project
Use the following set of commands to run a ruby program.

test folder contains the sample test cases

src folder contains the main code

```
cd project
./myruby test/test1.rb
```

This will print the output of the ruby program directly in the terminal

After testing run ```make clean``` to remove the binaries
